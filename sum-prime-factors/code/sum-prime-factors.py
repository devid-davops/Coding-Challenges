""" Notes about Challenge:
    1. Display the sum of all prime factors (if any exist) of a given number, N.
        -> input: 30
        -> output: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10

# David Booker-Earley's approach for this challenge:
    ## ** OVERVIEW **
        # 1. Accept a valid input.
        # 2. 
        # 3. 
        # 4. 
    
    
    ## ** ASSUMPTIONS **
        # 1. The integer input may have distinct or repeating prime factors (if any exist).
        # 2. The operator for (floor) integer-division "//" rounds down.
    
    
    ## ** SOLUTION **
      # Define a function that accepts a given number N.
        # Check for invalid inputs:
            # IF valid: proceed (e.g., check if type is integer).
            # IF invalid: print "Invalid entry." or do nothing.
        
        # Divide and Conquer -> ? :
            # Setup sub-function(s):
                # Block A -> Main and ?:
                    # ?
                
                # Block B -> ?:
                    # ?
      
      # Call main function on a given input.
      # Print results.
    
    
    ## ** IMPROVEMENTS (Extra Practice for Fun) **
        # 1. 
        # 2. 
        # 3. 
    
    
    ## Notes to self for Testing and Troubleshooting:
        # Take time to conceptually go through each block of code.
        # Track how the loops occur.
        # Track inputs & outputs.
        # Be sure the code & its action match conceptual approach.
