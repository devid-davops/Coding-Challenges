# Overview of Projects
I’m David, and this repo contains some of my favorite coding challenges that I’m trying to solve!

With an arguably healthy amount of fun and practical frustration, these exercises are helping me learn fascinating concepts in **Computer Science**.

I’m classically trained in **Mechanical Engineering**, yet my reverence for _Data_ and _Software_ expands as I strive for personal goals with Robotics. Thus, I’m aggrandizing my cognition to satisfy my curiosity while striving to provide innovative solutions to global issues.
