# David Booker-Earley's approach for this challenge:
    ## ** OVERVIEW **
        # 1. Accept a valid input.
        # 2. Conditionally partition input-iterable halfway (or nearly).
            # Repeat: Separate input into Left-side & Right-side.
            # Condition: Stop if sub-section has less than 2 elements.
            # An array of one (or zero) element can't be inherently unordered.
        # 3. Sort Left-side & Right-side separately.
        # 4. Build the sorted array by merging elements of each side in order.
    
    
    ## ** KEY TERMS **
        # element: fundamental ingredient of iterable
        # item: sub-section of original input-array, length may vary
            # (e.g., Left-side, Right-side)
        # N: length of array or sub-section (number of elements present)
        # partition: separate into smaller parts (i.e., split into items)
        
        # Example for clarity:
            # Consider the following list: A = [4, 0, 1]
            # Here, if A is partitioned into "Left" & "Right" sides:
                ## Inputs
                    # mid_index = len(A)//2 
                    # ... which simplifies to 3//2 and equals 1
                    # Left = A[:mid_index]
                    # Right = A[mid_index:]
                ## Outputs
                    # mid_index = 1
                    # Left = [4]
                    # ... the item "Left" has one element (N = 1)
                    # Right = [0, 1]
                    # ... the item "Right" has two elements (N = 2)
    
    
    ## ** ASSUMPTIONS **
        # 1. Array (or other iterable) contains only non-repeating numbers.
        # 2. Array is One-Dimensional of some length N.
            # (i.e., there are no nested iterables).
        # 3. When partitioning, integer-division "//" rounds down, and thus,
            # "N of Right-side" is greater than or equal to "N of Left-side".
    
    
    ## ** SOLUTION **
      # Define a function that accepts a given array.
        # Check for invalid inputs:
            # IF valid: proceed (e.g., check length of input).
            # IF invalid: print "Invalid entry." or do nothing.
        
        # Divide and Conquer -> Compare each element:
            # Setup sub-function(s):
                # Block A -> Main and Partition:
                    # IF N of input >= 2: Partition input.
                        # Create a Partition-Index to split input in half:
                            # part_index = N // 2
                            # -> Indices must be integers so "//" is used.
                            # -> Input could be an array or item.
                        # Return Partition-Index to use as a bookmark.
                        # Store "Left" and "Right" items from partition.
                        # Recursively call main on Right-side of bookmark.
                            # Store sorted output.
                                # -> Any Right item with N > 1 will likely be
                                # -> longer than the corresponding Left item,
                                # -> thus, process each Right item first.
                        # Recursively call main on Left-side of bookmark.
                            # Store sorted output.
                        # Call Block B to Merge:
                            # Combine Sorted-Left & Sorted-Right in order.
                        # Return sorted-array.
                    # ELSE:
                        # IF N < 2:
                            # Return the current input
                
                # Block B -> Compare and Merge:
                    # Compare element(s) of item Left with those of Right.
                    # Conditionally append or insert Left-element into Right:
                    # -> "Right" is already sorted (via function or "N = 1").
                        # for every element (elm) inside Left:
                            # IF current elm in Left >= the last elm in Right:
                                # Do MAX-case: append Left-elm to Right-item.
                            # ELSE Loop over index k from start to N of Right:
                                # if Left-elm is < Right-elm at index k:
                                    # insert Left-elm at k
                                    # Break from current loop-iteration      
      
      # Call mergeSort() on a given list and store the sorted output.
      # Print results.
    
    
    ## ** IMPROVEMENTS (Extra Practice for Fun) **
        # 1. Try variations of the "merge" or "combine" function.
        # 2. Apply different case-study circumstances.
        # 3. Account for nested iterables or empty items.
    
    
    ## Notes to self for Testing and Troubleshooting:
        # Take time to conceptually go through each block of code.
        # Track how the loops occur.
        # Track inputs & outputs.
        # Be sure the code & its action match conceptual approach.
